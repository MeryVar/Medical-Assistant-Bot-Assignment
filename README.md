## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced medical assistant using BERT embeddings to find the most relevant medical answers from a dataset of 16,401 professional medical Q&A pairs. The system provides intelligent medical information while prioritizing patient safety.

### Key Features

- **BERT-based Semantic Search**: Uses BERT embeddings for accurate medical question matching
- **Real Medical Answers**: Retrieves responses from professional medical dataset
- **Urgency Classification**: Automatic severity assessment (Emergency, High, Medium, Low)
- **Medical Category Detection**: Classification across 14+ medical specialties
- **Fast Retrieval**: Cached embeddings for rapid response
- **Safety-First Design**: Appropriate medical referrals and disclaimers

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing the BERT Medical Assistant

#### 1. Basic Testing with Python Script

Run the BERT medical assistant directly:

```bash
python src/bert_medical_assistant.py
```

This will:
1. Load BERT model (bert-base-uncased)
2. Load the medical dataset (16,401 Q&A pairs)
3. Create BERT embeddings for all questions (cached after first run)
4. Start an interactive medical consultation

#### 2. Interactive Testing Session

Once running, you can test with various medical questions:

**Emergency Scenarios:**
```
Your medical question: I'm having severe chest pain and can't breathe properly
```

**Routine Health Questions:**
```
Your medical question: What are the symptoms of diabetes?
```

**Specific Medical Conditions:**
```
Your medical question: What are the treatments for Breast Cancer?
```

#### 3. Expected Output Format

For each question, the system provides:

```
================================================================================
BEST MEDICAL ANSWER
================================================================================
Similar Question: [Most similar question from dataset]
Medical Answer: [Professional medical response]
Similarity: [Cosine similarity score]
Urgency: [Emergency/High/Medium/Low]

### Data Pipeline

```
Raw Medical Data → Data Analysis → Augmentation → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation
```

## Approach & Methodology

### 1. Data Strategy

**Initial Analysis**: Started with comprehensive dataset analysis to understand medical conversation patterns and identify augmentation needs.

**Data Augmentation**: Enhanced the initial dataset from 16 entries to 150+ medical conversations, then integrated a professional medical dataset with 16,000+ Q&A pairs from the MLE screening dataset.

**Preprocessing Pipeline**:
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Medical terminology standardization
- Quality filtering (92.7% retention rate)
- Strategic train/validation/test splits (80%/10%/10%)

### 2. Model Development

**Architecture Choice**: Selected DialoGPT for its conversation-specific training and ability to maintain context across medical discussions.

**Multi-Task Learning**: Implemented dual objectives:
- Primary: Medical response generation
- Secondary: Urgency level classification

**Knowledge Integration**: Developed rule-based medical knowledge enhancement to supplement model responses with appropriate medical guidance.

### 3. Evaluation Framework

**Standard NLP Metrics**:
- BLEU: N-gram overlap assessment
- ROUGE: Recall-oriented evaluation for response quality
- BERTScore: Semantic similarity using contextual embeddings
- Perplexity: Language model fluency measurement

**Medical-Specific Metrics**:
- Urgency classification accuracy
- Medical category precision
- Safety score (appropriate disclaimers)
- Response coherence and medical relevance

## Key Assumptions
